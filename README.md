# observable-tica
Attempted implementation of Frank Noe's summer students's work on observable tICA

Brennan Lee, working under the watchful eyes of Josh and Rafal

This repo contains the following:
  - An observable tica class object
  - A number of different tests to be run on the class checking the robustness of the callable functions
  - A few plots of MD data (taken from MSMbuilder example_datasets) projected onto observable tICA components
